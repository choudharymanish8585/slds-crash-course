# Tabs Release Notes

<!-- ## [Unreleased] -->
## 2.15.0

### Added

- Added additional styling hooks. See tab's styling hooks overview table for a full listing of the currently available hooks.

### Changed

- Adjusted color of unsaved tab indicator asterisk to comply with accessibility color contrast rules for active tabs and tabs with notification.
- Removed white `background-color` from `.slds-tabs_default` to expose surface color of the tabs parent container.
- The `back` icon present in tabs on mobile has been replaced by `chevronleft`. This is an inherited change from panels and it makes the icon consistent between the drilled-in states.

## 2.13.3

### Changed

- Treat Styling Hooks targeting text color as an element, previously referred to as a property. e.g. `--sds-c-tabs-item-color-text` => `--sds-c-tabs-item-text-color`.

## 2.13.0

### Added

- Enabled styling hooks for tab. See tab's styling hooks overview table for a full listing of the currently available hooks.

## 2.11.0

### Changed

- For touch devices:
  - Removed the focus styling from the button nested within `.slds-tabs-mobile__item` so the text color does not change on press for mobile (background color still changes on press)

## 2.10.0

### Changed

- For touch devices:
  - Changed the text color of `.slds-tabs-mobile__item` to Gray Color 12

## 2.7.0

### Added

- Added `slds-tabs_medium` and `slds-tabs_large` to modify the `font-size` and spacing of the tab items
- Added animation when activating a tab item
- Added `slds-tabs_default__overflow-button` to tabs with overflow so the Button Menu component can be slotted inside the tab item

### Changed

- Removed title caps from tab items
- Removed letter spacing from tab items
- Increased height of bar when a tab is active
- Changed HTML on [Tabs with Overflow](/components/scoped-tabs/?example=overflowing-items&variant=base) example so a Button Menu component is the trigger for the overflow menu

### Fixed

- Updated `slds-tabs-mobile` to have a white background by default, instead of a transparent background.
- Improved the color contrast of the text of a subtab when it is in focus
- HTML validation error on subtab indicators, swapped a `div` for a `span`
