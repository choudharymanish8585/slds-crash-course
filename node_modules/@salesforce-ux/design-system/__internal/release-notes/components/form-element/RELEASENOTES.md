# Form Element Release Notes

<!-- ## [Unreleased] -->
## 2.14.0

### Fixed

- Adjusted space between the form label and the information button icon for Mobile.

## 2.13.7

### Changed

- Revert compound form to its existing behavior of not wrapping to prevent unwanted side-effects in existing layouts.

## 2.13.1

### Changed

- Removed Mobile example under Stacked Alignment and Horizontal Alignment examples, as they did not conform to the specification.

### Fixed

- Small improvements to the UI text.

## 2.13.0

### Changed

- The compound form now wraps when the width of its parent container is smaller than the combined width of the form elements. This prevents the issue of input values becoming cutoff and unreadable due to shrinking compound form elements in a container with a small width.
- When `.slds-form-element` is a child of `.slds-form-element_compound`, it now uses margins instead of padding for its horizontal spacing. This fixes the issue of dropdowns being incorrectly offset because the dropdown uses the extra space created by padding as its positioning reference.

## 2.12.2

### Fixed
- For touch devices, fixed an issue with button icons being the incorrect height if using custom elements.

## 2.11.7

### Added

- Added documentation and examples for mobile/touch context

## 2.10.0

### Changed

- For touch devices:
  - Set the amount of space created for the edit icon to `$square-tappable` (2.75rem) which aligns with touch specific sizing
  - Increase the tap target size of `.slds-form-element__label` to `$height-tappable-small` (2rem), center with flex, and increase `font-size` to `$font-size-4` (0.875rem)
  - Set the tap target height of button-icons to `$height-tappable-small` (2rem) when inline with label text
  - Increase the font size of `.slds-form-element__static` to `$font-size-5` (1rem)
  - Within `.slds-form-element_readonly`, increase the size of `.slds-icon` to `$square-tappable-x-small` (1.5rem) and increase the height of `.slds-form-element__control` to `$height-tappable` (2.75rem) which aligns `.slds-form-element_readonly`'s touch height to other form elements
  - Remove the `min-height` from `.slds-form-element_readonly .slds-form-element__control` for denser read-only forms
