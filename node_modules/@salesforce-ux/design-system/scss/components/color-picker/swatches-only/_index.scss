/**
 * The Swatches Only variant should only render a group of individual swatches.
 * It should not render any of the main chrome of the color picker UI (no Summary
 * section, no Popover, no Tabset), it should only render the Color Picker swatches
 * selector. This component should be rendered inside a menu.
 *
 * ### Accessibility Notes
 *
 * The accessibility requirements for this Variant are slightly different from
 * the others:
 *
 * #### `.slds-color-picker__swatches`
 *
 * This element _needs_ a `role` of `menu`.
 *
 * #### `.slds-color-picker__swatch-trigger`
 *
 * This element _needs_ a `role` of `option`
 *
 * @summary Swatches Only UI
 *
 * @name swatches-only
 * @selector .slds-color-picker_swatches-only
 * @restrict .slds-color-picker
 * @support dev-ready
 * @variant
